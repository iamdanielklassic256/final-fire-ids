## üè¶ Wallets and Contributions

Once the saving group account is set up, the group will have three default wallets:

   - This wallet is where members' contributions for savings will be stored. It keeps track of all deposits made by members and the group's total balance.

   - This wallet is dedicated to managing the loans and their repayments. It tracks all loan applications, disbursements, and repayments made by the group members.

These wallets ensure that the group‚Äôs financial activities are well-organized, with clear records of contributions, loans, and other transactions.
